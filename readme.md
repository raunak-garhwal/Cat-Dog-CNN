# Image Classification with CNN

This repository demonstrates an **Image Classification** project using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **Keras**. The model is designed to classify images of cats and dogs using a dataset of labeled images. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features
- Image classification with CNN using Keras.
- Preprocessing of images with augmentation techniques.
- Binary classification (cats vs dogs).
- Easily customizable for other datasets and classes.
